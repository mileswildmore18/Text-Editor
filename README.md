## Description
Welcome to the Text-Editor. Here, you will get a chance to work editing on the web document not only online, but offline also in case you lose any internet connection and still work on the project.I learned about creating the webpack with adding any kind of files and combine them into one page. Here, you use a webpack that will allow you to import not only Javascript files, but you can combine CSS and HTML files all together and build it into a folder that connects all the files together. You will also get the chance see the manifest files that have been added, as well as seeing the service workers result of plugins installed on the page. You also will get a chance to see the storage been added based on the information you store, including the IndexedDB that stores a database that has been automatically created. You can install the program, it can be added as an icon on your desktop. You will also be able to reopen the text editor anytime you close it out, unless you clear the data from the storage unit. Have fun with creating databases with the webpack and enjoy your Text-Editor!
